            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                Thakasani serves as one of the Project Officers at IkusasaLentsha and is a proud graduate of Durban University of Technology (DUT), where he obtained a Bachelor of Engineering Technology in Electronic Engineering.
                After completing matric, he faced challenges in securing a place at a tertiary institution—not because of poor results, but due to a lack of information and guidance. He had to navigate the university application process alone, making numerous mistakes along the way. This experience became a driving force behind his passion to support other learners.
                By joining IkusasaLentsha in 2023, Thakasani is fully committed to ensuring that no student has to go through the same struggles he faced. He works tirelessly to empower and guide learners, especially those who have worked hard to achieve excellent matric results, so they can access the opportunities they deserve.
