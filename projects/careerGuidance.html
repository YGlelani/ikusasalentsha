    <h1>Career Guidance Program</h1>
    <p>
        Choosing the right career path starts with access to the right information. 
        Our Career Guidance Program empowers rural learners by exposing them to diverse career options available across South African universities and colleges.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Host Career Guidance Drives at high schools across Bergville and surrounding areas</li>
        <li>Share information about university programs, TVET colleges, bursaries, and in-demand careers</li>
        <li>Invite guest speakers from universities and industries to inspire and inform learners</li>
        <li>Distribute career booklets and resource guides</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>School Engagement:</h2>
    <p>
        Since 2022, we bring career guidance directly to learners through school visits, 
        giving them the tools to make informed decisions about their futures—especially in rural schools where access to such resources is limited.
    </p>

    <h2>Highlights:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reached over <strong>6000 learners</strong> since launch</li>
        <li>Ongoing partnership with Durban University of Technology (DUT) and other institutions</li>
        <li>Focused events like <strong>AgriVision 2025</strong> to promote sector-specific career exposure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why It Matters:</h2>
    <p>
        Rural learners often have limited knowledge about available career opportunities and how to pursue them. 
        Our program ensures they’re not left in the dark—it helps them dream, plan, and take action.
