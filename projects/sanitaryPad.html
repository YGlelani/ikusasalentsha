    <h1>Sanitary Pads Campaign</h1>
    <p>
        Periods shouldn’t be a barrier to education. Our Sanitary Pads Campaign supports rural schoolgirls by ensuring they have access to essential menstrual products—so they can attend school with dignity, confidence, and comfort.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Distribute sanitary pads to learners in rural schools</li>
        <li>Provide menstrual health education during handover events</li>
        <li>Promote community awareness around menstrual hygiene and gender equality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Annual Impact:</h2>
    <p>
        Now in its third year, this campaign has reached hundreds of girls through events hosted at schools such as 
        <strong>Ekwaluseni</strong>, <strong>Potshini</strong>, and <strong>Mafu High School</strong>. 
        Each year, we aim to expand our reach to even more learners.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters:</h2>
    <p>
        Many girls in rural areas miss school due to lack of access to sanitary products. Our campaign fights period poverty, 
        reduces absenteeism, and supports <strong>SDG 5: Gender Equality</strong> and the right to education for all girls.
    </p>

    <h2>Highlights:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2023–2025:</strong> Over 500 girls supported</li>
        <li>Annual Menstrual Health Events</li>
        <li>Support from local community leaders and donors</li>
    </ul>
